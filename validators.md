# Validator Integration
If you integrate your validator into Zaptos, this allows us to push stake into your validator. 

We aim to provide each validator with at least $1 million stake, which should result in at least 50k additional earnings per year (paid in Aptos token) to you.


## Permissions

Aptos blockchain requires `OwnersCapability` on the validator in order to deposit and withdraw stake. This means our smart contract has access to the validator and can push and withdraw stake from the validator.

Contract updates require a multisig approval from Aptos Labs, Zaptos Team, and OtterSec (leading auditing firm). 

We also require that validator partners set the stake times on their validator to 2 weeks.
